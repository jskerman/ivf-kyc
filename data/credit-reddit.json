With IVF (and often all the disappointment you had even leading up to IVF), you're used to things not working and hearing bad news. Being pregnant is hard, especially the first half of the pregnancy (IMO) because there's so many things that can go wrong...you have to make sure the pregnancy isn't ectopic, you have to make sure it's not a chemical, you have to make sure there's a heartbeat, then you have to make sure the heartbeat is fast enough, then you graduate from the clinic and have to wait to see your OB, then you do NIPT testing, then the NT scan, then waiting until the anatomy scan, etc.  \n\n\nTW success:\n\nI was very stressed at the beginning of my pregnancy but felt much better once I graduated from my clinic.

Yes there are a lot of other people who are running the marathon alongside you, but you're already exhausted from your first marathon so each step feels so much more difficult. I was actually lucky enough to have a really good pregnancy experience for the most part.

I was lucky to have 1 egg retrieval, followed by 1 frozen embryo transfer which has resulted in my current pregnancy. My pregnancy has been awful though. Some of the IVF anxiety kind of followed into the early pregnancy and didn\u2019t really ease up until my 20 week anatomy scan.

I would say they\u2019re both hard mentally and emotionally but pregnancy comes with more optimism. Pregnancy has been a lot harder on me physically than IVF was, but I had a fairly straightforward path with IVF and know that some people go through a lot more.  \n\nA lot of pregnant women may disagree with this but based on my personal experience, I feel pregnancy is WAY more understood by society than fertility treatments are and that makes a huge difference. It makes the pregnancy a bit more bearable. I feel like my pregnancy struggles are validated a lot more than my IVF struggles were. Sure, you get your share of stupid comments and obnoxious jerks, but in general people care about pregnant women. A lot of people ask how I\u2019m feeling both physically and mentally. In general, the world has been accommodating. If I have to miss something because of exhaustion, people generally understand. Women who have been through it will commiserate with you, which makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone and men are generally willing to help a pregnant woman. People also love to ask about your pregnancy which makes some women uncomfortable but I enjoy it. So overall, I feel pretty supported. And when going through a hard experience, that universal sense of understanding has been nice. With IVF I definitely didn\u2019t feel that way. I felt a lot more alone; it was hard to know how much to divulge. The people who I did open up were caring and kind but didn\u2019t fully get it. They don\u2019t realize how emotional and exhausting and time consuming it is. If you have to miss something because of IVF, people aren\u2019t as understanding.
