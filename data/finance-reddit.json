As everyone intimately familiar with IVF knows, you likely have a high level of the emotional stress involved in the process. From the realization that this may be your only option to conceive, the worry that it still won't work, and countless others. That's all before you even consider the finances and insurance components of this equation. \n\nWhile I know there are a handful of employers and insurance plans and policies that have some level of coverage, from my understanding, it's not at the forefront of most insurance policy makers' minds and the value is not placed on IVF and conception like we all clearly think it should be. \n\nDespite your status in life (married vs. unmarried/wealthy vs. poor) there is clearly not a value placed on IVF in our society that would cause there to be a significant change in the way IVF is perceived and funded, despite the fact that based on a recent article 33% of Americans have personally, or know someone, that has used fertility treatments. \n\nI am one of the lucky few that has a spouse with *some* level of IVF coverage and it's still a stressful and overwhelming obstacle to try and tackle amid the most crucial of times during IVF. \n\nMy purpose in reaching out today is to try and establish an IVF Finance and Insurance Reform Coalition. My hope is to set up a platform for those with stories to tell of finance and insurance hurdles to discuss those and outline them. While I don't exactly know what that entails or how this will play out, this has just become a passion of mine to pursue. As there is too much talk about the Right to Choose regarding abortion, yet the majority (if not all) of those pursuing IVF do not have a choice. It is our only option to conveive and yet we are left in the dark and alone more often than not. So while this is my first attempt at creating a movement and organization of this sort, a few thoughts on how it may play out are below. \n\nMy initial hope is to take some of these concerns and bring in medical expertise and experience to help put medical justification to our claims and hone in a few talking points that can be taken (with sound medical backing) to the policymakers in each state to hopefully push for insurance reform for IVF.\n\nAs an example, I am currently going through a prescription appeals process with our insurance company because they have placed the medication our doctor prescribed on their personal NDC Lock-out list. So she is not eligible for reimbursement. However, their approved substitute doesn't have a medical advantage, nor does the drug on the lockout list have overly adverse side effects or case studies to indicate it is ineffective. Her drug also doesn't have a generic substitute; however, the board of the lockout list decided that across the spectrum, there is an acceptable alternative (which coincidentally....) costs about 1/3 of the medication originally prescribed. Also is unsettling the number of drugs that have been added to these NDC lockout lists over the past several years. \n\nWhile I understand this our current model, insurance companies make modifications based on profit, it's also unfortunate that insurance is dictating medical practice to the degree they are. \n\nWhile I have tried to remain coherent, I fear I am rambling now. \n\nSo with that, I will leave it at this, if you feel strongly that there should be reform in the stigma around IVF and the impacts that have on financing and insurance to support IVF, please send me a direct message with an email address, I'd love to discuss. \n\nThanks", "num_comments": 7, "score": 7, "top_comments": ["I'm going to \"approve\" this post, though it skirts the line of \"self promotion\" or \"non pre-approved research\".... simply because you're 100% correct... the coding for IVF is complete BS and it needs to be fixed."], "link": "/r/IVF/comments/uj37wm/ivf_financing_and_insurance_reform_coalition/"}, {"title": "IVF Financing", "content": "Hi -\n\nWondering if anyone has any experiences with financing of IVF treatment.\n\n1.

Nausea, fatigue, etc. Everyone said my symptoms were such a good sign, but they were actually because my HCG was wildly high due to chromosomal abnormalities. One loss was a confirmed T21 and the other loss unfortunately couldn't be determined, but the HCG being so abnormally high in that one also indicates a chromosomal issue.

The stress of the hope and then the disappointment wasn\u2019t something I wanted to deal with, plus the expense (I\u2019m OOP so the transfer cost and the meds could be significant with failed transfers). While studies about end results seem to show about the same live birth outcome for most women when testing or not, there is a significant reduction in number of transfers and miscarriage. Testing might not increase your likelihood of a baby, but for me it reduces the emotional turmoil and the expense. \nSecond, which relates to the first, is just time. I\u2019m almost 36 and was hoping to bank for more than one child if possible - it helps me to know how many normals I have because more ERs after a transfer might not be realistic. I would have tested no matter my age, but I definitely would have been more ok with the idea of skipping it if I was younger. \nI\u2019m also really glad I tested - in my first ER I had 7 embryos and four were abnormal. The real kicker is that had I transferred based on grade, the first THREE would have been non-viable! That just blew my mind. \nA euploid doesn\u2019t guarantee success but I just wanted to avoid guaranteed failure. \nGood luck! I\u2019m sure whatever you decide will be right for you!", "I would test. I\u2019m 34 and tested, I\u2019m also banking because I would ideally want more than one.

I am so thankful for the 10% reduction in miscarriage rate with a euploid embryo. I also found prepping for transfer and the wait after transfer mentally and physically exhausting, so again in hindsight, I am glad I did what I could to up my chances a bit per transfer.\n\nThey had actually told me not to bother with my age, but 4 out of 10 were aneuploid, and one was mosaic. One of my aneuploids was a 5aa embryo that they very likely could have chosen to transfer first.\n\nWith low AMH, knowing how many \"good\" embryos I had helped me decide whether or not to do another ER before transferring as I want more than one child and know it will only get harder for me in the future, so I wanted to bank what I needed now.

None of my friends have had to do IVF and just don\u2019t understand.\n\n\nHow do you know you\u2019re done with IVF? Or how do you justify continuing when your exhausted?\n\n\nLong story long, we did two egg retrieval a year ago and ended up with two embryos (we had a 4BB & a 4BC). Then I had surgery this summer to remove a uterine niche that would have interfered with implantation. We transferred the 4BB in November and it failed. Then the 4BC in December, and I was just notified that it also failed. So no more embryos and we\u2019re back to square one. \n\nWe were able to afford this through employer benefit. We originally said that if both FETS failed we were done. However, we have enough left on the employer benefit to do 1 more retrieval BUT any embryo transfers would be out of pocket. We\u2019d likely only do 1 more transfer regardless of how many embryos we get because of finances and emotional warfare.\n\nI\u2019m really torn on what to do. I\u2019m tired of the medications, the affect on my body, the appointments and all of the disappointment. I\u2019m also turning 36 this month so I don\u2019t know how much longer I want to do this to my body. My head logically says it\u2019s time to throw in the towel, but my heart is having a hard time letting go, especially knowing that the average for a successful pregnancy is after 3 transfers (I also know that just an average not a standard and it can take more or never happen). \n\nWe also do have two beautiful children (6 & 3) and we started this process to have a third. Our kids have been asking for a sibling for awhile now and it\u2019s so hard to tell them it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth doing another retrieval just in case we get more embryos only for my heart to be broken again by a failed FET or for my heart to be broken by not getting embryos at all. I\u2019m also not sure I\u2019m ready to close this chapter. I\u2019ll take any advice or perspective.

But my monitoring appointment in late December showed no fluid so we're hopeful the surgery was successful. FET will hopefully happen this upcoming cycle. \n\nHowever, we have slightly different circumstances as we do still have embryos banked after two ERs. We agreed that if we go through all the embryos we have without success we're done, but that would mean more transfers than is statistically expected. I think if I was in your place I would want to transfer at least three euploids before giving up, as I would see being on the other side of a 95% success statistic as a sign that my body just couldn't do it again.

Thought I would comment because I had a similar result of degenerating eggs with all 3 of my retrievals!  I could not find anyone similar.\n\nSome of my eggs always came out degenerated in my retrievals, but not all.  I was also told not to be hopeful. HOWEVER, the ones that they were able to fertilize had a good fertilization rate and blastocyst rate. Most of my blasts ended up being top quality and I also had euploids. My first FET took, but I miscarried because of issues in my uterus that had not been diagnosed. I have since fixed those issues and had a second FET recently that took. Currently 6 weeks 3 days.

My numbers looked picture perfect and I had a lot of eggs.\n\nAfter THREE retrievals it is my personal opinion that degeneration happens due to over exposure to meds and eggs growing too fast and too big. For example in my retrievals, my eggs always grew crazy fast and all over the place in size and some would end up in the mid 20smm. My doctor kept having to reduce the dose EVERY SINGLE time. Whereas in a regular cycle (i did IUIs and just had a natural transfer cycle), my normal egg size is only 18mm. I am of the opinion, that these large 25mm eggs they are getting from me are the degenerated ones and the ones that they get that are good are the ones in the 18mm range. Although there is no way to tell what eggs came from which size sac, it works out that way when you look at the numbers for me in terms of how things were measuring.\n\nThe is all just my theory. You can't just take a person with naturally low hormone levels (non elevated FSH), a lot of eggs, and eggs that grow to 18mm naturally.. and then start pumping them with loads of drugs and make their eggs grow huge.\n\nI hope you can do another cycle.

Doctors are so used to people that don't respond to meds.. they don't often consider the fact that some people are OVER responding.\n\nDon't take this to mean your eggs are sh\\*t.

Had the surgery to remove and repair tubes. Post surgery, doctor informed me that he had to remove both tubes (I was asked to tell my wife). We were both devastated given the initial positive diagnosis, but we now know the next steps to take.\n\nIVF Route: Consult with doctor post surgery (3 weeks), and discuss the next steps to take. We move forward with IVF \u2014 now we needed to secure financing for the process. (Financing was secured through one of the large IVF specific medical creditors). Cost is roughly $27,000 to be payed in 5 years (auto deduction is encouraged and interest rate is discounted ($480 monthly). \n\nPrep for Egg Retrieval and Egg Retrieval: Numerous medicines will be delivered to your home or designated pharmacy. Be prepared to help your partner to take shots (extremely uncomfortable for them) in the butt. Eggs are retrieved in an outpatient setting. The doctor retrieved 19 eggs. \n\nEmbryo and Genetic Testing: After assessing the viability of the eggs, 12 were deemed healthy for the next phase. I submitted a sperm sample and eggs were fertilized. After this process, 9 eggs turned to embryos. After genetic testing was done (significant cost), we were left with 4 healthy embryos. Because we had more than 8 embryos, we had to pay an additional $1,600 out-of-pocket. Fine print on our contract allows for 8 embryo genetic testing. All 4 embryos are boys.\n\nTransfer: Additional shots, pain, and discomfort will be felt by your partner as she preps for transfer. We opted to transfer 1 embryo at the suggestion of our doctor. This transfer itself is a very quick outpatient process. \n\nWaiting Period: We waited roughly 3 weeks to find out that the embryo transfer was successful.\n\nPregnancy and High Risk Doctors: IVF and over 35 patients are \u201crequired\u201d to see a high risk doctor monthly during pregnancy. Months 1-4 of the pregnancy were relatively easy (occasional heartburn). \n\nDevastating News Month 5: During a visit to the high risk doctor, we were told that our baby had enlarged ventricles in the brain. No other information/outcomes were forthcoming. At this point, we start to panic and worry our baby will have developmental issues. Subsequent visits prompted us to have a fetal MRI done during month 7. The results \u201cconfirmed\u201d enlarged ventricle beyond normal ranges (14-18 range), corpus callosum was not fully formed, and the brain was too smooth for the developmental stage.\n\nWaiting in Dread and Marriage Counseling: We both had issues processing the devastating news, which led to us seeking marriage counseling. No definitive answers were ever given by the high risk doctors. Neonatologists counseled us that seizures, developmental delays, cerebral palsy, and other issues could present themselves. We were devastated by the news, but our marriage was strong.\n\nLabor and Birth: Wife was induced at 1:30am 5/11/2023, 1 day short of full term, and our baby was born 5:49pm of the same day. \n\nAwaiting bad news: Neonatology doctor and nurse were present during birth and he was later taken to have a head ultrasound done to asses issues.\n\nWaiting: The next day both neonatologists came to our room and told us after consulting with pediatric neurologists, our son was cleared of any possible brain issues.\n\nNow: 5/17/2023 We have a healthy and beautiful baby boy with zero issues.

We decided to decline the genetic carrier screening and testing. We weren\u2019t exactly sold knowing that a positive test still had a lot of uncertainty on whether a child might have something (25-50%). Plus, the added cost and time it takes for the testing discouraged us. It came across more as a money grab and way to squeeze an additional $1000-2000/person in an already expensive process.

The costs are from the provider the fertility clinic chose. It is not covered by my insurance (I checked).

The cost included the genetic consult counseling session that is required before moving forward, once results are in.

I did not factor in the additional testing of the embryo to select those options out (also do not have the cost of that process, but anticipating it will be another $500-1000 based on a convo with the clinic today). \n5.
