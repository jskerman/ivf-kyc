During that time period, we got a break from ivf and started really enjoying life not thinking about kids, and after a week of family visiting we starting doubting what we wanted. I freaked out that I was contemplating changing my mind after 4 ERs and did a few therapy sessions. In the end, we decided to stop ivf before attempting a transfer because of the doubt. We are very thankful we have frozen embryos and will keep them frozen.

I had to make a choice.\n\nAfter a lot of deliberation & intense conversations, I realised the magical feeling that I was ready was never going to come, but how did I feel about being 60 years old and never at least trying? \n\nIn that I felt that we had to at least give it a go, if it didn\u2019t work - it would be somehow easier to reconcile and be ok with, as we were so 50/50 on the whole thing. We both agreed to commit 12 months to the process and after that, we\u2019d move on and commit to being childfree as our path. We didn\u2019t want to be in a TTC phase for too long. \n\nI knew I had had endometriosis in the past, it was cut out and removed via laparoscopy when I was 27, and I only ovulated sporadically. So it was going to be a case of straight to Fertility Treatment to maximise our chances in 12-14 months. I saw the RE for the first appointment In November, had all the pre tests completed by Christmas. We started the \u201cclock\u201d at the first cycle start, which was mid January. \n\nI had 2 ERs between Feb - June. Not going to lie after the second one, I felt rubbish emotionally and physically. And I was ready to just throw the whole thing in. Once I got my period and my hormones calmed down, I felt better and re-committed to the process.\nBut I did panic and wonder if I was doing the right thing.\n\nAs it turns out, that cycle resulted in the conception of my now 13 month old son. He was supposed to be a fresh transfer, but because I was in such a bad state, I requested to switch to a frozen cycle and transfer at a later time. \nWhich was the next cycle a month or so later. \n\nI do think this was some kind of divine intervention, as I don\u2019t know if my body would have been in the right state with a fresh transfer\u2026 he was the best quality embryo and I hate to think that he might have not had a good chance to implant. So my choice to wait till my body \u201ccalmed down\u201d and do a FET, I feel was for a reason.\n\nI had a lot of childhood trauma. My mother has severe BPD and was an absolute nightmare. I was parentified from a young age, she had the emotional maturity of a toddler and it was hard work on so many levels. I no longer have contact with her for various reasons, but the emotional and mental scars she left, really did impact my feelings on becoming a parent myself. \n\nI had felt numb to the idea for as long as I could remember. Like there was some kind of emotional block there when it came to being maternal. I was afraid of not bonding with my child. Once I started to unpack those feelings with a therapist, we got to the root of those feelings & it was my lack of feeling for my mother and projecting that onto my own hypothetical relationship with a child. \n\nAs it turns out, when I found out I was pregnant and when I first saw his heartbeat, first scan, I just adored him. It\u2019s not like that for everyone - but I was truly amazed that it was for me. \n\nThe moment I saw him & held him - it was like it was meant to be all along.\n\nThis last 13 months has shown me so much and taught me a lot about myself. I am capable of so much more than I ever thought I could be as a parent & I am loving being that person. \n\nThis is only my perspective, and this isn\u2019t representative of everyone\u2019s experience. But it is possible to be against the idea of children as well as completely on the fence and still have a positive outcome. \n\nIVF is hard no matter what. It\u2019s a different kind of hard for people in varying ways. \nBut ultimately for me it was the best way for us to maximise our time on the TTC journey, given the past fertility issues for me, I was then 36 and my husband was 42. \nWe got lucky and the second transfer worked, so 8 months into our 12 month commitment, I was pregnant. \n\nI wish you all the best on this. I hope whatever happens, you\u2019re happy and fulfilled.", "I don\u2019t know your age but I could have wrote this a couple years ago in my late 20s (pre ivf).

I\u2019m currently pregnant again, we were in the fence for 1 or 2. I\u2019m always feeling on the fence and we thought we\u2019d try one transfer and then be done either way.

I\u2019m not looking forward to the next two years but toddlerhood is wonderful and I do like the idea of older kids and adult children.

I saw babies in their mothers' arms at the grocery store and craved the all-encompassing love that parenthood brings. I was ready to start our family. But when I got my IUD removed I suddenly had a wave of panic (of course, I had no idea how much we would struggle). I drove home crying, not knowing how long my husband and I would be just a family of two for. I love the life we have built together and I feared that changing. It was terrifying.\n\nFast forward a year and a half. I'm sure many of us started out pinning nursery ideas and planning a life through pregnancy, but slowly it becomes just about trying to get a positive test. Throughout infertility, I lost sight of the baby I desired and became so invested in  *getting* and staying pregnant. But starting IVF restored some of my lost hope.\n\nAfter my ER, suddenly things started to feel very real. I think part of this feeling was the hormones and physical stress my body was under after suffering from pretty severe OHSS and having my estrogen through the roof. But I suddenly had the same feeling I did after stopping birth control. *Oh my god, my life could change forever next month. Will I be a good parent? Should we have done this?* It was scary. After spending *so* much money on this how could I suddenly have doubts?\n\nIVF is a huge investment.

I have an almost 4-year-old daughter. She has a pretty intense personality. There are days when I envy childless people. Like, I can\u2019t wake up at 10 am on Saturday, go to brunch and drink mimosas, and then take a 2-hr nap. There are days when the irksome toddler behavior puts my husband and me in a bad mood - whining, screaming, repeating the same thing over and over again, you name it. \n\nBut\u2026when they\u2019re babies, they are so delicious.

Raising a child is a magical experience, especially if you like children and are interested in childhood development. It is an honor and a privilege to give a child a safe, happy childhood. \n\nSo now I\u2019m doing IVF to try to have a second one. There are times throughout this process when I\u2019ve second guessed myself. My kid sleeps a solid 9-10 hours a night with rare interruption.

My cousin did, and there was a STARK difference between how we behaved while TTC. It doesn\u2019t help the pain of this process, however, that still made me question the same things. Here is my answer: I\u2019m not doing this for right now so that I can have an infant. I\u2019m terrified of that stage and the lack of sleep and how hard it is. I\u2019m not doing this because I love every single kid I meet, most of them suck and I have my own ideas of parenting lol. \n\nBut I\u2019m doing this now, so that I can have a family for the rest of my life. Because I cannot imagine my husband and I not having soccer games to go to, or be available for when kids come home from school after a shit day.

Simultaneously, I want to look back at them and know that I\u2019ve left amazing people behind when I leave this earth. And feel that love at my bedside whenever my time comes. My fear is if I don\u2019t do this now, while I\u2019m enjoying my life, that my final years will be so much more difficult and emotionally costly than this IVF journey. \n\nI\u2019m estranged from my family and had my relationship with my nieces and nephews ripped away from me.

I mean, breakdown. Sobbing, could hardly breathe, every single question and doubt showed up in my mind that very second- maybe I\u2019m just not meant to be a parent, what if I don\u2019t love them, what if I don\u2019t want my life to change that much, I mean All. Of. It. I seriously considering pulling the plug and leaving. \n\nI went through with it and am now pregnant, and I\u2019ll tell you this much- when I was in the 2 week wait and I tested early and it was negative, I suddenly realized how sad it made me. I did NOT have an instant realization immediately after the FET, I still wasn\u2019t sold. But as soon as I tested and realized wow, maybe it didn\u2019t work (wait, so I\u2019m off scot-free?) is when I realized that it was indeed what I wanted.

I never lost hope, until my ex-husband said we should just try naturally and if we get pregnant-great, if not then that\u2019s God\u2019s will. We started telling people we don\u2019t even want kids anymore, but deep inside I wanted to have 8-and in those moments I was begging God to just give me one. We got divorced, found a partner who wanted to have kids, he had means to help me with IVF, we started with 4 healthy embryos, but had 2 FET implantation failures, so we are now down to 2. To top this, I think I\u2019m going to end up doing all of this on my own. Im taking a break from IVF because mentally, physically, emotionally and psychologically I am exhausted. I am also afraid that none of our embryos will implant. I feel like I am drowning at times, sometimes I feel like a failure, that the one thing I want to be is not happening to me.

Your 1 viable PGA tested embryo could very well be the baby you long for, in which case\u2026everything went as it should. \nHere is a little story.;\nAt 36 my husband and I started IVF after several IUI\u2019s and 12 years of \u201ctrying\u201d. I have PCOS, his sperm have low motility. We opted for ICSI. We got 11 eggs at retrieval, mostly because the drugs they gave me at retrieval didn\u2019t do a thing and I could only go through with one ovary because the pain was so horrid. Out of the 11, 7 fertilized and only 2 of those survived to day 5 blast. I was devastated that I wasn\u2019t strong enough to get all the eggs possible. We could have had so many more chances. We did not PGA test. \nOne of the two day 5 blasts was fresh transferred on day 5 and that is my 5 year old daughter sitting beside me now.\nFast forward to 2020. We were ready for baby #2. In January 2020 we transferred the other embryo that had been on ice since 2017. Unfortunately it did not work. \nThen the pandemic hit. We were not able to schedule another IVF round until July 2020. My father had a heart attack and died June 17, 2020 (one day after my daughter 2nd bday). He wanted us to have another baby so bad though, so i garnered strength from that, and i held it together and did the IVF round in July even though my state of grief was immeasurable. \nWe got 22 eggs and 15 of them fertilized and 11 made it to 5 day blast. HOW AMAZING!!! We were over the moon. We did not PGA test again.  \nThe fresh transfer in July 2020 - failed. \nFrozen transfer in Sept 2020 - failed. \nFrozen transfer January 2021 - failed. \nFrozen transfer March 2021 - failed. \nTook some time off. \nFrozen transfer September 2021 - failed. \nHow did we have so many embryos and have back to back failures. No sign of pregnancy at all. I couldn\u2019t even find any stories like mine when i searched online. We were devastated and I was so tired. We were defeated and ready to give up even though we had so many embryos left. I just physically couldn\u2019t do it anymore. However, we decided to do one more transfer and make it our last shot. My husband didn\u2019t even come with me for the transfer and I ended up sick with a cold right during the week of the transfer. I pretended I didn\u2019t have it so that I didn\u2019t have a non refundable cancelled round. We transferred in January 2022 and it worked. We had our son Sept 25, 2022.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t matter how many embryos you have, it truly only takes one. If we had PGA tested ours, we may have only ended up with one or 2 out today the 11 that made it to day 5, but we probably would have saved ourselves some time and heartache with not having to go through so many before one worked. \n\nGod is still very much in charge in my opinion.

In my case, I did not have a history of infertility and had previously gotten pregnant and carried a child to term, but we were doing PGTM for a genetic disease that is autosomal dominant, which means that we lost half of the embryos to that disease and then did PGTA after that. \n\nI did three retrievals for a total of 29 eggs at age 36. From those, we had 5 embryos that did not carry the genetic disease we were testing for. This was an outstanding result. Keep in mind that when you do PGTA, those embryos tend to have a pretty high success rate.

We transferred two the first round and then I changed a few diet things (no alcohol, pineapple and pomegranate weekly, 2 Brazil nuts daily and carnivore meal plan) and my doctor did 2 PRP infusions the week of transfer and started me on thyroid meds and blood thinners. She said my recurrent miscarriages and failure to implant were good reasons to start those meds and it worked! We are 14 weeks now with our miracle baby.

And I feel ok about it!\" and I left this group. After years of IVF and three losses I knew my body couldn't handle more. \n\nBut... I ended up on a Facebook group for gestational surrogacy and I connected with the most amazing woman who agreed to carry our embryo for us. She had a successful FET in April. I wanted to share that Reddit doesn't really have a Gestational Carrier community, but it is HUGE on Facebook and somewhat on Instagram (I love \"TheBiggestAsk\") account. \n\nI had complicated feelings about asking another woman to carry for me. I honestly had some ignorant beliefs about surrogacy (that it was exploitative to low income women and parents using surrogacy didn't want to carry their own babies, like celebrities that want to avoid stretch marks). And I just want to say, that's the furthest thing from true. What I've found is a community of intended parents who are gay men, trans women, and women who can't carry their own babies like myself. And surrogates who are all wonderful mothers themselves who had easy pregnancies and births and want to share this gift with other families. There are medical guidelines and laws around surrogacy that require surrogates to be mothers who are raising their children, who are financially stable and not low income (cannot receive government assistance) and had uncomplicated pregnancies and births.\n\nI just wanted to pop back into this community to share because I remember how many hours I spent here getting advice, and honestly I was in a really dark place.
